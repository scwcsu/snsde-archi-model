    documentation="The principle of ‘safe people’ is about ensuring that individuals accessing data are trained and authorised, to use it appropriately. &#xA;&#xA;The safe people principle will be upheld by secure data environments by making sure that users are verified before access is granted and are able to access appropriate data only. Patients and the public will also be engaged in decisions about who can access their data."/>
